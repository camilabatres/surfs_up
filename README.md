# Surfs Up Analysis 
## Overview 
* This project runs an analysis on weather dataset from Oahu, Hawaii. I focus on the months of June and December to see how much it changes every 6 months. This analysis would help us decide if we want to open a surf/ice cream shop since temperature trends can influence the amount of business. This analysis will display the trends to the investor who wants to know if there is an opportunity to stay open all year long. 

## Results 
* The mean temperature for both months are between the low 70s. This shows that the temperature is stable throughtout the year, however, June is slightly warmer than December.
* The minimum temperature for the month of December is 56 while the minimum temperature for June is 64. This is almost a 10 degree difference between the two months. This demonstrates that the end of the year, the temperature is colder when it comes to the lowest temperatures. 
* The maximum temperature for December 83 and the max temperature for June is 85. Both months have similar maximum temperature. We can conclude that the average maximum temperature throughout the year is in hte 80s.
